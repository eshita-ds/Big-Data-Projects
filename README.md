    <td>Social media listening involves tracking and analyzing conversations, mentions, and trends on social platforms. It enables brands to address feedback, improve products, and develop effective marketing strategies. Two approaches to social media listening were explored with this project historical and real-time data. Historical data provides a retrospective view, helping identify trends and plan campaigns, while real-time data offers immediate insights, aiding ongoing campaigns, events, and promotions.
