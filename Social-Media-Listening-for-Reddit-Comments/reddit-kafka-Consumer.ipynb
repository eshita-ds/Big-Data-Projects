The comfort issues with vr headsets are very well known, and they would have known about the lack of software applications better than anyone.\\n\\nSo, they have a very expensive headset that is uncomfortable to wear for long periods and very little people can do with it.  How did they think consumers would react?\\n\\nIf they\\u2019d made it so people could link them to pcs and stewm, etc, it would be very different but locking it down to the apple ecosystem shuts out those who want a quality headset most.\"\n",

You're very closed off and in your own isolated space when using it and you can't share the experience with others around you.  Great for people who live or work alone, but very awkward for people who need to be aware of those around them.  I think that's why Apple put the facial gestures and the eye camera pass through on the Vision pro, to make the people more present with their surroundings.  But that doesn't solve the problem.\\n\\nI think Vision Pro would be great for education and classrooms.  Great for artists and doctors and engineers.  Anyone who needs to work with objects in a 3D space.  But the average person sitting on their couch or on the bus or walking around downtown has no need for it.

They figured they would put the hardware and platform out there and let devs figure out what to do with it and let it grow organically\\n\\nThis approach worked for the watch. But that's because lots of people want a fitness tracker anyway and here's a fancy one that integrates nicely with your iPhone and lets you take calls and read messages in a pinch. Also very handy for pinging your iPhone. The Watch is pretty damn successful though it's not much talked about.\\n\\nIt's not working out for the VP, because for one thing it costs 3500$. Nobody NEEDS this thing. Apple could've targeted professionals e.g. medicine or engineering but they wanted consumers instead. They could've targeted gamers but they didn't probably b/c other companies are doing it already. It's a general consumer device that's too expensive with no killer app on launch. Because it's too expensive with too few users, devs have a hard time justifying even buying one to explore it, much less spending more resources to develop for it. Developing for iOS devices is already a pita. This has to be pita to 11.\\n\\nIf Apple wants this to succeed, THEY have to put in the work and develop stuff for it. THEY have to put in more money to create content like immersive sports to show how cool this stuff is. A few demos in the app store won't cut it. They need to put out fresh content like every month at least. They have to show they're all in on this themselves if they want other people to buy in\"\n",
